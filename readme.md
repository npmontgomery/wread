Wread simplifies common actions of ``pickle``, ``txt``, and ``csv``, making life just a little easier for noobs like me and anyone else who wants to write a few lines less of code.

## Installation

OS X & Linux:

```
pip install wread
```

## Usage example

Wread includes three types of function: ``pickle``, ``txt``, and ``csv``. Import all of them by importing the package ``wread``.

```
import wread  
----
# Append a line to a text file, creates if doesnt exist.

append_txt_line(input_file, content)
----
# Checks if file exists, if not, writes content to new text file.

write_2_txt(input_file, content)
```

```
import wread
----
# Saves variable as pickle file.

save_pickle(output_file, variable)
----
# Loads pickle file variable

read_pickle(input_file)
```

```
import wread
----
# Load csv and output row content as lists in list of rows.

csv_list_rows(input_file)
----
# Load csv and output individual row as list.

def get_csv_row(input_file, line_number)
----  
# Appends items in list to new line of csv file. Makes file if does't exist.

csv_append(input_file, input_list)
```
